# Keg_Washer
This was a project done for the Dam Brewhouse to run an automated keg washer.

I made this while I was a student, so some of the code is still a little rough around the edges, but it's been functional for 2 years with no problems.

There is no GUI, and it is unlikely that I will make any changes, so consider this unsupported.
