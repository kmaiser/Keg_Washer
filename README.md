# Keg Washer
Author: Kurt Maiser

This was a project done for the Dam Brewhouse to run an automated keg washer using a raspberry pi.

As such, I used the bcm2835.h library made by Mike McCauley, which can be found here https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html.

I made this while I was a student, so some of the code is still a little rough around the edges, but it's been functional for 2 years with no problems.

There is no real GUI, and all prompts are in the command window. 

It is unlikely that I will make any changes, so consider this unsupported.
