# Keg Washer

AUTHOR: Kurt Maiser
LICENSE: GNU GPLv3.0

This was a project done for the Dam Brewhouse to run an automated keg washer using a raspberry pi.

As such, I used the bcm2835.h library made by Mike McCauley, which can be found here https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html.

I made this while I was a student, so some of the code is still a little rough around the edges, but it's been functional for 2 years with no problems.

There is no real GUI, and all prompts are in the command window. 

In regards to the license, feel free to copy this code, change it, use it for whatever you want, if anybody makes something cool using this, all the power to you.

It is unlikely that I will make any changes, so consider this unsupported.

Cheers,
Kurt Maiser
